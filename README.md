# Vehicle License Plate Recognition (VLPR) 🚗🔍

VLPR is a Python project designed for automatic license plate detection and recognition from images or video streams. It's suitable for surveillance or traffic monitoring applications, featuring advanced algorithms for plate detection, character segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR).

## Key Features 🛠️

- **License Plate Detection:** Utilizes advanced image processing algorithms to detect and locate license plates within images or video frames.
  
- **Character Segmentation:** Segments characters on the license plate for individual recognition using techniques like contour detection and morphology operations.
  
- **Character Recognition:** Employs optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to accurately recognize and extract characters from the license plate image.
  
- **Real-time Processing:** Capable of processing images or video streams in real-time, making it suitable for integration into surveillance systems or traffic monitoring applications.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with VLPR, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Run the main script to start the VLPR system.
4. Input images or video streams containing vehicles with visible license plates.
5. View the detected license plates and recognized characters in the output.

## Contributing 🤝

Contributions to improve the accuracy, efficiency, or usability of the VLPR system are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
